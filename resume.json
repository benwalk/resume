      "summary": "Episodic memory provides many important capabilities to a cognitive architecture. One of the challenges of creating a general episodic memory system is to be effective when given no information about the agent's task. In this paper, we present an effective algorithm for detecting the relevance of the features of episodic memories while only being told when an agent completes a goal. We demonstrate this algorithm using an episodic learning agent in a task that provides the agent with a mix of relevant and irrelevant features. The episodic learner outperforms a variant Q-Learning algorithm that has proven effective in the past."

Ben likes to learn and grow and is organized, responsible and a wonderful glue to a team. \nIf it is something he is interested in, I think Ben would also be amazing at management. But, really, he's probably good at whatever he sets his mind to doing."

I worked with him as a colleague first, and was super impressed by his technical abilities and his instincts in tackling technical problems and bugs. When I managed him, under tough times at our company, he continued to grow into a fantastic backend engineer. He would serve well on any team where there is a need for an engineer that doesn't get rattled, and a need for someone that has an ever growing understanding of software engineering concepts and principals."

He was supposedly our \"junior\" Java guy, but when all the senior folks left during an acquisition, he was the guy who put together architectural schematics and taught the senior guys from the other company how everything worked.\n\nHe's the ultimate team player, and a great developer. Highly recommend."
